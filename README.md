# Interview-Analysis-Personality-Prediction-Facial-Expression-Detection
Conventional interviewing procedures often lack to grasp a deep understanding of their
interviewees. Interviewers could fail to observe important facial features, textual tone, and
body language during the interview process. The proposed system provides a thorough approach to understand how the interviewee behaves and feels during the interviewing process.
A significant feature of this system is the ability to measure and quantify the big 5 traits of
personality with the help of machine learning and natural language processing. Additionally,
this project presents how the amalgamation of various algorithms and approaches can help in
determining the overall personality of the interviewee.
